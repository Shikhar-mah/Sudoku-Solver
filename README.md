# Sudoku Generator and Solver

This project implements a **Sudoku Generator** and **Solver** in C++. The generator creates a valid Sudoku puzzle, and the solver efficiently solves any given Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm.

## Features

- **Sudoku Generator**: Generates valid 9x9 Sudoku puzzles with unique solutions.
- **Sudoku Solver**: Solves any 9x9 Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm.
- **Customizable Difficulty**: You can adjust the difficulty level of the generated Sudoku puzzle.
  
## File Structure

- `sudoku_generator.h`: Contains the logic for generating Sudoku puzzles.
- `sudoku_solver.cpp`: Implements the Sudoku-solving algorithm using backtracking.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sudoku-generator-solver.git
   cd sudoku-generator-solver
   ```

2. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ sudoku_solver.cpp -o sudoku_solver
   ```

3. Run the solver:
   ```bash
   ./sudoku_solver
   ```

   You can modify the input puzzle within the code or extend the logic to input a puzzle through a file.

## Usage

- **Generating a puzzle**: The Sudoku generator creates a valid Sudoku puzzle which can then be solved.
- **Solving a puzzle**: Provide any 9x9 Sudoku puzzle, and the solver will return the solution.

## Future Improvements

- Add a GUI for better user interaction.
- Optimize the backtracking algorithm for better performance.
- Allow users to input puzzles through the command line or external files.
